It's fun to play and the variety of games are just fun to watch.    Events: I have an entertaining and enjoyable family. Let's face it, we're kids so we can be rude sometimes. This weekend we went to a festival where we saw lots of family movies and played all the arcade games. I loved it. I've played so much more this week than I did last week. I'm pretty sure I have fifty more to go and I'm hoping I can play some of those games this weekend. Also, I'm learning a lot more languages. I'm excited to try different ones because I'm so happy I got to learn Spanish. I hope one day I can marry someone who wants to be around English! I want my baby to hear English, too!\n",
