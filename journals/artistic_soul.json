        "entry": "I recently heard a story about a kind act that someone did for a stranger. A woman was walking home late at night when she noticed a homeless man on the side of the road. She stopped and asked him if he was okay, and he said he was hungry. She went to the nearest store and bought him some food and a blanket, and then she stayed with him until he was done eating. It was a small act of kindness, but it made a big difference in the man's life. It's stories like this that remind me of the power of kindness and how it can make a difference in someone's life."

It's a great way to take a break from the stress and just enjoy the moment."
